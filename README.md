### Data Table
Attribute                      | Type        | Description                | Notes
-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MSSD_ID                        | integer     | Unique numerical reference ID for each seismic source | ID 00-300 is section rupture <BR>ID 300-500 is fault rupture <BR>ID 600-700 is a multi-fault rupture
name                           | string      |                            | Assigned based on previous mapping or local geographic feature. <BR><BR>For sections and faults, the name of the fault (flt_name) and larger multi-fault (mflt_name) system they are hosted on are given respectively.
basin                          | string      | Basin that source is located within | Used in slip rate calculations
class                          | string      | intrarift or border fault  | 
length (L<sub>s</sub>)                    | real number | straight-line distance in km between fault tips; sum of L<sub>sec/sub> for segmented faults; sum of L<sub>fault/sub> for multi-faults | measured in km to 1 decimal place. Must be greater than 5 km (except for linking sections).
area                           | integer     | Calculated from L<sub>s</sub> multiplied by Eq. 1 or based on fault truncation. | measured in km<sup>2</sup>
strike                         | integer     | Azimuth of straigth line between the fault tips. <BR>azimuth is <180째 | Used as input for slip rate estimates in Eq. 2
dip (&delta)                   | integer     |                            | When no previous measurements are available, a best estimate of 53째 is assigned, and no uncertainty is explored for dip in the source geometry. However, in the slip rate calculations, this is randomly varied between 45째 and 65째. <BR><BR> No dip is assigned for multi-fault sources, as different participating faults may have different dips.
dip_dir                        | string      | Dip direction: compass quadrant that the fault dips in. | 
slip_type                      | string      | source kinematics (e.g. normal, thrust etc). | All sources in the MSSD are assumed to be normal faults.
