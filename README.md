# Malawi Seismogenic Source Database - MSSD

The Malawi Seismogenic Source Database (MSSD) is a geospatial database that documents the geometry, slip rate and seismogenic properties (ie earthquake magnitude and frequency) of active faults in Malawi. Each geospatial feature represents a potential earthquake rupture of 'source' and is classified based on its geometry into one of three types:
- section
- fault
- multi-fault

Source types are mutually exclusice, and so if incorporated into a PSHA, they should be assigned relative weightings.

The MSSD is the first seismogenic source database in central and northern Malawi, and represents an update of the South Malawi Seismogenic Source Database (SMSSD; Williams et al., 2021) because it incorporates new active fault traces (Kolawole et al., 2021; Williams et al., submitted - MAFD), new geodetic data and a statistical treatment of uncertainty, within a logic tree approach.

## Database Design
The MSSD consists of two components:
1) A 3D geometrical model of seismogenic sources in Malawi
2) The mapped trace of each source, with associated source attributes (### Data Table).
